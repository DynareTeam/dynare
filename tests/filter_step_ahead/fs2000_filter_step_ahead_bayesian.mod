 * This file replicates the estimation of the cash in advance model described
 * Frank Schorfheide (2000): "Loss function-based evaluation of DSGE models",
 * Journal of Applied Econometrics, 15(6), 645-670.
 *
 * The data are in file "fsdat_simul.m", and have been artificially generated.
 * They are therefore different from the original dataset used by Schorfheide.
 *
 * The equations are taken from J. Nason and T. Cogley (1994): "Testing the
 * implications of long-run neutrality for monetary business cycle models",
 * Journal of Applied Econometrics, 9, S37-S70.
 * Note that there is an initial minus sign missing in equation (A1), p. S63.
 *
 * This implementation was written by Michel Juillard. Please note that the
 * following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare implementation of the
 * model.
